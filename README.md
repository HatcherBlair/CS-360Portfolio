# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of this app is to allow the user to keep track of the items in their kitchen.  This app allows for the user to enter different items and where they are in their kitchen as well as the amount they have on hand.  This allows the user to check and see what is in their kitchen and helps plan meals and manage food waste.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
In order to accomplish this there was a login screen, a database screen, and a settings screen.  The login screen and the settings screen were pretty standard.  The database screen displayed all of the items that were stored in a list and allowed the user to tap on an item to edit or delete that item.  You were also able to add more items to the list from the database screen.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
To code the app I started by designing the UI and figuring out what functionality needed to be implemented.  Then I got the design finalized and started to implement functionality.  First, I prioritized getting the navigation and information displayed on screen properly.  Then I worked on the database and implementing the persistant storage and the login verification.  In the future I will continue to use this design process.  Knowing what the final product should look like before starting gives you a clear end point, and implementing the UI first will identify issues before they arise.  Then, finally desiging the logic will make sure that everything can be tested on a functioning UI.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested to make sure things were functional in the android studio emulator.  I tested after every function was implemented and if the function didn't change the screen or the rest of it wasn't implemented yet I used toast messages to let me know that the function was being called and working properly.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The largest challenge I encountered was in making my UI functional.  In order to make my UI functional I had to change the way things were being displayed on screen.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I felt I was most successful in demonstrating my skills in my navigation, I was proud of the way that my app navigated between screens and did so quickly and efficiently.
